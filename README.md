# Welcome to WIRG!  

## About Us  
The [Wireless Interdisciplinary Research Group (WIRG)](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/wirg/) is a research group at the **University of Colorado Boulder**. Our research focuses on improving radio frequency (RF) spectrum availability, which is essential for:  
- **Wireless communications** (cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.)  
- **Weather observing** (Earth Observing Satellites - EOS)  
- **Radio Astronomy** (scientific observations of the Universe)  
- **Military and aviation operations**  

Our work spans wireless communications, passive and active spectrum sharing, spectrum policy, and hardware security, ensuring secure spectrum sharing for both communications and scientific purposes. Several projects are **NSF** and **NASA** funded.  

## The Spectrum Challenge  
RF spectrum is a scarce resource due to the explosion of wireless devices‚Äîsome forecasts predict 95% of internet-connected devices will be wireless. The spectrum crunch has led to regulatory efforts like:  
- **2010 Presidential directive** to free up 500 MHz for broadband.  
- **Shift from exclusive allocations to spectrum sharing.**  

Traditional **Radio Quiet Zones (RQZs)** protect sensitive receivers by restricting nearby transmissions, but they waste spectrum when unused.  

### üîπ **Radio Dynamic Zones (RDZs)**: A New Approach
Unlike RQZs, RDZs protect systems outside the zone from powerful transmitters inside. This enables:  
- **Efficient spectrum use**‚Äîspectrum is available when not in use.  
- **Better protection**‚Äîmanaging high-power transmissions dynamically.  

### üîπ **Our Mission**  
We aim to maximize RF spectrum utilization through secure spectrum sharing, ensuring co-existence of passive and active systems, with a focus on RDZs.

## [SOPP](https://pypi.org/project/sopp/)
The SOPP package assists astronomers in optimizing observation scheduling to mitigate radio interference from satellite sources. This is achieved by computing the positions of satellites relative to the observation facility and determining which of these satellites cause interference with the main beam during the observation.

## [RF Survey](https://github.com/NSFCUSWIFTPASS/RF_survey)
The RF Noise Survey is an open source tool developed by the WIRG lab at the University of Colorado Boulder to measure baseline radio frequency (RF) interference. This tool is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 connected to an Ettus Research B200mini USRP (Software Defined Radio). It aids in understanding and improving RF spectrum sharing for both communications and scientific purposes.

## [Spectral Kurtosis](https://github.com/NSFCUSWIFTPASS/spectral_kurtosis)
This repository contains code for implementing Frequency Separated Spectral Kurtosis (FSSK), a novel method for calculating spectral kurtosis without the need for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as well as three other ways of calculating spectral kurtosis. The technique, developed as part of our research, enhances real-time detection of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) using Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology.

## RFS Server
This repository is the server side component of the RF Survey system. It continuously monitors designated directories for incoming data files‚Äîsuch as survey results, hardware metadata, and status updates‚Äîgenerated by the RF Survey code. It processes these files to extract metadata and compute statistics, and then updates a PostgreSQL database with the processed results.

## Daily Status Check
This repository contains the code that runs daily checks and sends out a daily email about the device health of all of the RF Survey devices.

## [CBSD](https://github.com/NSFCUSWIFTPASS/CBSD)
This code emulates the communication occurring between a Spectrum Access System (SAS) and a Citizens Broadband Radio Service Device (CBSD). Communication between a SAS and a CBSD consists of the following 6 components. Note that each request needs to include the required certificates, which are not included in this repository. Each response to a request either contains a response code 0 if the request was a success or a different response code with a message describing why the request failed.
