# Welcome to WIRG!  

## About Us  
The **Wireless Interdisciplinary Research Group (WIRG)** is part of the Computer Science Department at the **University of Colorado Boulder**. Our research focuses on improving **radio frequency (RF) spectrum availability**, which is essential for:  
- **Wireless communications** (cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.)  
- **Weather observing** (Earth Observing Satellites - EOS)  
- **Radio Astronomy** (scientific observations of the Universe)  
- **Military and aviation operations**  

Our work spans **wireless communications, passive and active spectrum sharing, spectrum policy, and hardware security**, ensuring **secure spectrum sharing** for both communications and scientific purposes. Several projects are **NSF** and **NASA** funded.  

## The Spectrum Challenge  
RF spectrum is a **scarce resource** due to the explosion of wireless devices—some forecasts predict **95% of internet-connected devices will be wireless**. The **spectrum crunch** has led to regulatory efforts like:  
- **2010 Presidential directive** to free up 500 MHz for broadband.  
- **Shift from exclusive allocations to spectrum sharing.**  

Traditional **Radio Quiet Zones (RQZs)** protect sensitive receivers by restricting nearby transmissions, but they **waste spectrum** when unused.  

### 🔹 **Radio Dynamic Zones (RDZs)**: A New Approach  
Unlike RQZs, **RDZs** protect systems **outside** the zone from powerful transmitters **inside**. This enables:  
- **Efficient spectrum use**—spectrum is available when not in use.  
- **Better protection**—managing high-power transmissions dynamically.  

### 🔹 **Our Mission**  
We aim to **maximize RF spectrum utilization** through **secure spectrum sharing**, ensuring **co-existence of passive and active systems**, with a focus on **RDZs**.
